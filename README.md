# PYQNow

PYQs at your fingertips, success in sight

PYQNow is a free website which provides one click access to all PYQs PDFs of BIT Exams.

NOTE: For obvious reasons (and a bit bias), this only works for the CSE branch (which is my branch btw). The main reason being the time required to collect all those subjects and links.
